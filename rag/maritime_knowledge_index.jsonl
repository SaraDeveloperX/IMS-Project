The intended voyage shall be planned in advance taking into consideration all \npertinent information and any course laid down shall be checked. \n7. On taking over the watch the ship's estimated or true position, intended track, \ncourse and speed shall be confirmed ; any navigational hazard expected to be \nencountered during the watch shall be noted. \n8. During the watch the course steered, position and speed shall be checked at \nsufficiently frequent intervals using any available navigational aids necessary to \nensure that the ship follows the planned course. \n9.

The officer of the watch should keep his watch on the bridge which he should in no \ncircumstances leave until properly relived.

In a vessel \nwith separate chart room the officer of the watch may visit this,  when essential, for a \nshort period for the necessary performance of his navigational duties, but he should \npreviously satisfy himself that it is safe to do so and ensure that an efficient look -out \nmaintained. \n4. There may be circumstances in which the officer of the watch can safely be the sole \nlook-out in daylight.

What is VTS?\nVTS are shore-side systems to monitor and manage ship traffic to ensure the safety and efficiency of ship \nmovements. \nVTS is recognized internationally as a navigational safety measure through the International Convention \non the Safety of Life at Sea 74/78 (SOLAS).  In particular, the provisions in SOLAS Chapter V (Safety of \nNavigation) Regulation 12 provides for Vessel Traffic Services and states, amongst other things, that:\n■   “Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) contribute to safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation and \nprotection of the marine environment, adjacent shore areas, work sites and offshore installations from \npossible adverse effects of maritime traffic.”, and\n■   “Governments may establish VTS when, in their opinion, the volume of traffic or the degree of risk \njustifies such services.”\nSOLAS also states that Contracting Governments planning and implementing VTS shall, wherever \npossible, follow the guidelines developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).\nIMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services defines VTS as: services implemented \nby a Government with the capability to interact with vessel traffic and respond to developing situations \nwithin a vessel traffic service area to improve the safety and efficiency of navigation, contribute to safety \nof life at sea and support the protection of the environment.\n1.2. Purpose of VTS\nThe purpose of VTS is to contribute to safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation and the \nprotection of the environment within the VTS area by mitigating the development of unsafe situations \nthrough:\n■   Provision of timely and relevant information on factors that may influence the ship’s movements and \nassist onboard decision-making.\n■   Monitoring and management of ship traffic to ensure the safety and efficiency of ship movements.\n■   Responding to developing unsafe situations.\nGreen light from lighthouse Skallen within VTS area Marstrand", "metadata": {"source": "VTS-MANUAL-Edition-8.5-Simples-pages.pdf", "domain": "VTS", "page": 9}}

Benefits of VTS\nKey benefits of implementing VTS include:\n■   identification and monitoring of ships;\n■   strategic planning of ship movements;\n■   management of ship traffic;\n■   provision of information that may influence \nship movements and assist onboard decision-\nmaking; \n■   support to the navigational safety of ships \nthrough the provision of essential navigational \ninformation to assist onboard navigational \ndecision-making; and\n■   support to related activities such as pilotage, \nsearch and rescue, maritime security and law \nenforcement.\nUnlike other marine aids to navigation, VTS, \nbeing active, has the capability to interact and \ninfluence the decision-making process on board \nthe vessel.  For example, VTS might detect the \ndevelopment of a vessel running into danger, and \ncan thus alert such vessels accordingly.  As the \nmajority of maritime accidents can be attributed \nto human factors, the involvement of VTS, and \ninteraction with it, can provide a significant \nadditional safeguard.\nWhere an incident has occurred, VTS can also \nbe used to support other incident mitigation \noperations. In the context of vessel traffic \nsafety, VTS might support, for example Maritime \nAssistance Services (IMO Resolution A.950(23)), \nPlaces of Refuge (IMO Resolution A.949(23)), \nSearch and Rescue, firefighting, pollution \nresponse and salvage operations.\n1.4. Development of VTS – A Brief \nHistory\nThe movement of goods by sea has supported \nworld commerce for centuries, giving rise to a \nneed for ships to navigate safely and efficiently. \nTo this end, authorities throughout the world have \nprovided aids to navigation in and around their \ncoastal waters. The earliest aids to navigation \nwere shore-side beacons and lights, followed by \nthe introduction of buoys. Over the years, these \naids have been steadily improved upon with \ngreater visibility and range and the addition of \naudible signals.\nIn the 1940s it became clear that short range, \naudio-visual aids to navigation were insufficient \nto enable the full utilization of port facilities in \nall conditions of visibility and increasing traffic \ndensity. Adverse weather and congestion resulted \nin delays of vessel traffic movement, which in turn \ncreated serious disruption to port operations with \nconsequences for other modes of transport.\nA consensus emerged among maritime experts \nthat traffic monitoring using shore-based radar \ncombined with communications could be applied \nto enhance safety and efficiency in port areas \nand their approaches. The first radar based Port \nControl station was established in Douglas, Isle of \nMan, in 1948.\nMasan VTSO, Korean Coast Guards", "metadata": {"source": "VTS-MANUAL-Edition-8.5-Simples-pages.pdf", "domain": "VTS", "page": 10}}

In the 1950s, a number of \nshore- based radar sites were established around \nthe world as well as in European ports, including \nthe approaches to the port of Amsterdam in 1952 \nand the entire Rotterdam port area in 1956.\nAlthough these early systems were intended to \nminimise traffic delays and increase the efficiency \nof traffic flow in general, attention was also given \nto the number of shipping accidents and the \nways in which these might be reduced. Studies \nwere carried out to see what effect that these \nrudimentary vessel traffic services were having on \nreducing the number of accidents in port areas \nusing radar surveillance. The studies concluded \nthat, in addition to increasing the operational \nhours, thereby providing better utilization of a \nport’s capacity, the number of accidents was also \nbeing reduced.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s major shipping disasters, \nincluding Torrey Canyon, Metula and Amoco \nCadiz, made the public keenly aware of the \nenvironmental damage that a shipping accident \ncould cause. The ensuing public outcry for \nprotection of the marine environment brought \nsubstantial pressure on authorities to implement \nmeasures to enhance the safety of shipping. The \nconcern that such disasters might happen in port \napproaches and port areas further expanded the \nuse of radar surveillance and the management of \nvessel traffic.\nFigure 1 Harbour control by radar – Douglas harbour installation by Cossor Ltd", "metadata": {"source": "VTS-MANUAL-Edition-8.5-Simples-pages.pdf", "domain": "VTS", "page": 11}}

The \nexercise of regulatory management over shipping \nfrom ashore was a new phenomenon and it soon \nbecame apparent that some form of international \nharmonization of these emerging vessel traffic \nservices was needed.\nIn 1968, the Inter-Governmental Maritime \nConsultative Organization (IMCO) \nexamined the Recommendation \nA.158 - ‘Port Advisory Services’, \nadopted by the Maritime \nSafety Committee, which \nrecommended to Governments \nthat they consider setting up \nsuch services in ports and \ntheir approaches, that warrant \nit by the importance and nature \nof their traffic, particularly in \noil terminals and ports where \nnoxious or hazardous cargoes \nare loaded and unloaded. This \nRecommendation also instructed \nmasters that an early indication of the \nexpected time of arrival to the appropriate \nauthorities would also contribute to safety, due \nregard being given to the actual conditions and \nthe existing local arrangements.\nIn 1985 the International Maritime Organization \n(IMO) adopted Resolution, A.578(14) - ‘Guidelines \nfor Vessel Traffic Services’. In general, these \nGuidelines described the operational procedures \nand planning for VTS. The Guidelines did not \naddress liability or responsibility, which needed to \nbe considered by the authority establishing a VTS, \nnor did they create new rights to enact legislation \non the requirements for shipping. With respect \nto personnel, the Guidelines did not specifically \naddress recruitment, qualifications and training of \nVTS operators.\nThe requirements for VTS were considered \nby International Association of Marine Aids to \nNavigation and Lighthouse Authorities \n(IALA) and a follow-up study was \nundertaken jointly with the \nInternational Maritime Pilots’ \nAssociation (IMPA) and the \nInternational Association \nof Ports and Harbours \n(IAPH).  The original IMO \nResolution on VTS was \nrevised and updated \nwith the adoption in \n1997 of IMO Assembly \nResolution A.857(20) \n- ‘Guidelines for Vessel \nTraffic Services’.\nRecognizing that various \norganizational, operational and \ntechnological developments have taken \nplace globally in a rapidly changing maritime \ndomain since 1997, IALA coordinated a review \nand update of the Resolution during its 2018-\n2022 work programme for submission to the IMO.  \nThe submission culminated in adoption of IMO \nAssembly Resolution A.1158(32) in December \n2021.  \nSMA - A container ship arrives at the port of Gothenburg in VTS area Göteborg\nCar carrier Autorunner", "metadata": {"source": "VTS-MANUAL-Edition-8.5-Simples-pages.pdf", "domain": "VTS", "page": 12}}

Introduction\nThis chapter provides an overview of the interna-\ntional regulatory and legal framework for estab-\nlishing VTS.\nThe key components of the international frame-\nwork include:\n■   International Convention for the Safety of Life \nat Sea (SOLAS) 1974; \n■   IMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for \nVessel Traffic Services; \n■   IALA Standards; and\n■   National Law.\nIn addition to the VTS specific components listed \nabove, the United Nations Convention on the Law \nof the Sea (UNCLOS) lays down a comprehensive \nregime of law and order in the world’s oceans and \nseas.\n2.2. International Convention for the \nSafety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)\nThe SOLAS Convention is generally regarded as \nthe most important of all international treaties \nconcerning the safety of merchant ships. The first \nversion of the Convention was adopted in 1914 \nfollowing the Titanic disaster and the version in \nforce today was adopted in 1974. SOLAS Chap-\nter V (Safety of Navigation) identifies certain nav-\nigation safety services which should be provided \nby Contracting Governments.\n2.2.1. SOLAS Chapter V Regulation 12 – \nVessel Traffic Services\nSOLAS regulation V/12 (Vessel Traffic Services) \nrecognizes VTS internationally as a navigational \nsafety measure.  In particular, it provides for VTS \nand states that:\n“Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) contribute to safety \nof life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation \nand protection of the marine environment, adja-\ncent shore areas, work sites and offshore instal-\nlations from possible adverse effects of maritime \ntraffic.”\nSOLAS also states that:\n■   Governments may establish VTS when, in \ntheir opinion, the volume of traffic or the de-\ngree of risk justifies such services; \n■   VTS may only be made mandatory in the sea \nareas within the territorial seas of a coastal \nState; and\n■   Governments planning and implement-\ning VTS shall, wherever possible, follow the \nguidelines developed by the IMO.\nUnder the general provisions of treaty law and \nof IMO Conventions, States are responsible for \npromulgating laws and regulations and for taking \nall other steps which may be necessary to give \nthose instruments full and complete effect so as \nto ensure safety of life at sea and protection of the \nmarine environment.\n2.3.

For the purposes of IALA this definition \nincludes Vessel Traffic Services.\n16.2. Aim\nThe aim of IALA is to foster the safe, economic \nand efficient movement of vessels, through im-\nprovement and harmonization of aids to navi-\ngation worldwide and, and by other appropriate \nmeans, for the benefit of the maritime community \nand the protection of the environment. \nTo achieve world-wide improvement and harmo-\nnization of Vessel Traffic Services IALA publishes \nStandards, Recommendations, Guidelines, and \nModel Courses specifically related to the devel-\nopment, implementation and operation of Marine \nAids to Navigation.\nIALA achieves its aim by, among other things:\n■   Developing international cooperation by pro-\nmoting close working relationships and assis-\ntance between members;\n■   Collecting and circulating information about \nthe activities of its members as well as en-\ncouraging, supporting and communicating \nrecent developments;\n■   Facilitating mutual exchange of information \nwith organizations representing the users of \nmarine aids to navigation;\n■   Formulating and publishing appropriate Stan-\ndards, Recommendations,  Guidelines, Man-\nuals and other appropriate papers;\n■   Encouraging members to take into account \nthe development of multi-purpose systems \nwhich may also be used, for instance, to \nmonitor the marine environment;\n■   Establishing committees, working groups or \nother such bodies as may be appropriate to \nstudy special issues;\n■   Facilitating assistance to services or organi-\nzations requesting help within the marine aids \nto navigation and allied fields, whether tech-\nnical, organizational or training;\n■   Organising conferences, symposia, semi-\nnars, workshops and other events relevant to \nits work.", "metadata": {"source": "VTS-MANUAL-Edition-8.5-Simples-pages.pdf", "domain": "VTS", "page": 35}}

Vision\nThe Strategic Vision for IALA for the period 2018-\n2026 defines two goals:\nGoal 1 - Marine Aids to Navigation are developed \nand harmonized through international coopera-\ntion and the provision of standards.\nGoal 2 - All coastal States have contributed to a \nsustainable and efficient global network of Marine \nAids to Navigation through capacity building and \nthe sharing of expertise.\nTo achieve these Goals, eight strategies are de-\nfined in the Strategic Vision.  These include:\nS1 - Develop standards suitable for direct cita-\ntion by States, in areas deemed important by \nthe General Assembly, and the related Recom-\nmendations and Guidelines.\nS2 - Position IALA as the source of standards, \nknowledge, and expertise that will enable \nStates to provide Marine Aids to Navigation, in \naccordance with relevant international obliga-\ntions and recommendations.\nS3 - Coordinate the further development of \nMarine Aids to Navigation, taking into account \nevolving operational and functional require-\nments, new techniques, new technologies and \nsustainability.\nS4 - Continue to develop capacity building ac-\ntivities to improve the global provision of Ma-\nrine Aids to Navigation.\nS5 - Harmonise the information structure and \ncommunications for future navigation by creat-\ning standards, and by cooperation with other \ninternational organizations, to achieve world-\nwide interoperability of shore and ship sys-\ntems.\nS6 - Improve and harmonise the delivery of \nVTS globally and in a manner consistent with \ninternational conventions, national legislation \nand public expectations, to ensure the safety \nand efficiency of vessel traffic and to protect \nthe environment.\nS7 - Work towards the transformation of IALA \ninto an IGO, to enable the organization to \nachieve its aim and objectives.\nS8 - Ensure that the resources and capabili-\nties of the Secretariat are sufficient to enable \nIALA and its committees and organs to reach \nits goals.\n16.4. Standards\nIALA Standards are a vital component of the Stra-\ntegic Vision, providing the overarching framework \nto harmonise Marine Aids to Navigation world-\nwide, including VTS, through implementation by \nall coastal States.  The framework provides a hi-\nerarchy of five documents, including:\n■   Standard: IALA Standards form a framework, \nimplementation of which by all coastal States \nwill harmonize Marine Aids to Navigation \nworldwide. IALA standards cover technology \nand services and are non-mandatory.\n■   Recommendation: IALA Recommendations \nspecify what practices shall be carried out in \norder to comply with a Recommendation, and \nmay be referenced, in full or in part, in an IALA \nStandard.\n■   Guideline: IALA Guidelines describe how to \nimplement practices normally specified in a \nRecommendation.\n■   Model Course: IALA Model Courses are train-\ning documents which define the level of train-\ning and knowledge needed to reach levels of \ncompetence defined by IALA.\n■   Manual: IALA Manuals provide an overall view \nof a wide subject area. The IALA Dictionary is \nconsidered a Manual.\nIALA Standards are suitable for direct citation by \nStates in the interest of an efficient and harmon-\nised global delivery of VTS.\nImplementation of a Standard by a Marine Aids \nto Navigation provider is at the choice of the or -\nganization.  IALA Standards are not mandatory. \nHowever if an organization wishes to claim com-\npliance with an IALA Standard then it should im-\nplement the normative Recommendations refer -\nenced in the Standard.\nThe IALA Standards and associated documen-\ntation specifically related to VTS are provided in \nChapter 2.4 – IALA Standards.\nBelgium - Zeebrugge", "metadata": {"source": "VTS-MANUAL-Edition-8.5-Simples-pages.pdf", "domain": "VTS", "page": 36}}

VTS Committee\nIALA has been associated with the development \nof VTS for over 50 years, having first discussed \nthe use of shore-based radar installations and \nVHF radiotelephone communications as a means \nof providing improved navigational facilities for \nshipping.  IALA followed the developments of VTS \nand, recognizing that these were uncoordinated \nand differed from country to country, considered \nthat there needed to be a forum at which similar \nKiel Canal - Germany", "metadata": {"source": "VTS-MANUAL-Edition-8.5-Simples-pages.pdf", "domain": "VTS", "page": 38}}

DEFINITIONS\nThe definitions of terms used in this Manual can be \nfound in the International Dictionary of Marine Aids \nto Navigation (IALA Dictionary) at https://www.ia-\nla-aism.org/wiki/dictionary/index.php/Main_Page .\nThe definitions were checked as correct at the time \nof going to print.  Where conflict arises, the IALA \nDictionary should be considered as the authorita-\ntive source of definitions used in IALA documents.\nproblems could be discussed and experiences \ncould be shared.  \nConsequently, in 1980 or 81, IALA established a \nVTS Committee to undertake these tasks.  Since \nthen the VTS Committee has grown steadily and \nhas developed into the foremost forum on Vessel \nTraffic Services in the world.\nA primary objective of the VTS Committee is the \nprovision of sound and timely guidance and ad-\nvice to those involved in VTS matters.  Given the \ncomplexity of modern, multi-discipline systems \nand management, it rarely does this in isolation, \nconsulting frequently with other committees, al-\nlied organizations and the IMO.\nThe formal posts on the VTS Committee include a \nChair, Vice Chair and a Secretary.\nThe Committee’s work programme is decided \non a 4-yearly basis by the IALA Council, but new \nitems may be added to meet changes in the mari-\ntime industry and the demands of members.  \nWork items are normally allocated, where this is \nappropriate, to working groups (WG) within the \nVTS Committee that have the following broad re-\nmits:\n■   VTS Operations\n■   VTS Technology\n■   VTS Training\n16.8. World-Wide Academy (WWA)\nIn January 2012 IALA established the World-Wide \nAcademy, the vehicle by which IALA delivers \ntraining and capacity building. The Academy is an \nintegral part of IALA, independently funded.\nThe Academy works closely with IMO and other \nkey Organizations, such as IHO, to develop ca-\npacity building in a coordinated manner as part of \nthe United Nations “Delivering as One” initiative. \nThe Academy establishes and manages system-\natic aids to navigation capacity building to enable \nnational authorities of developing States in target \nregions to meet their obligations under the UN-\nCLOS and SOLAS Conventions.\nThe Academy is there to promote the work of the \nIALA Committees and assist in the development \nof IALA standards related to marine aids to navi-\ngation training.
